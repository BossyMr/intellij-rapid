# Rapid Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA

This plugin adds language support for the RAPID programming language to IntelliJ IDEA.

* **Code Insight:** Adds syntax highlighting and more advanced context-based highlighting. Highlights troublesome code
  together with an understandable error message and, for some errors, presents possible solutions which it can
  automatically perform.
* **Editor Support:** Provides context-sensitive code completion. As well as a customizable code formatter, with a
  settings menu similar to that of other languages supported by IntelliJ IDEA.
* **Refactoring:** Supports refactorings to improve productivity, such as a refactoring to safely rename elements and
  all of its associated usages.
* **Data Flow Analysis:** Highlights unreachable code or expressions which might otherwise produce an undesirable
  result, such as indexes which are out of bounds or variables which might not be present. The plugin builds a data flow
  graph for the program.
* **Robot Integration:** Integrates with a local or remote robot. Automatically fetches builtin elements from the remote
  robot as well as existing modules on the robot. Supports uploading and running a local program on the robot from
  IntelliJ. Also supports debugging programs using breakpoints and variable values.
